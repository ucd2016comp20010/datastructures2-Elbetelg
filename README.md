lab1:
Q5: Yes all test passes.
Q6: A SinglyLinkedList has a null pointer after the last node meaning it has an end and a beginning whereas a CircularLinkedList much like a circle has no beginning and no end.
Q7: In what situations would you prefer to use a linked list to an array? it's easier to insert and remove elements without relocating and reorgansing the entire structure.
Q8: Describe 2 possible use-cases for a circularly linked list (2-3 sentences for each). 1: photo gallery: When you are swiping through photos, after you reach the very last image, the next swipe often brings you right back to the first photo. this  is an example of circularly linked list usage.
2: The Clock: A clock is a physical circularly linked list of numbers. When the second hand reaches 60, it doesn't hit a null wall or stop, it simply rotates back to 1. This continuous loop allows the system to track infinite time using a finite set of nodes (1 through 12).
